      <p class="faq1">I often get asked plenty of basic finance questions and I frequently see certain things that people are always curious about or just general topics that there are plenty of misconceptions and ambiguity around so I thought I would take a crack at a few things that I know people are curious about.</p><br><br>

  <h1>Q:Should I get a second job?</h1>
      
  <h1>A:Yes, if you are young and have no resposibilities outside of bills there is absolutely no reason you should not have a second job.</h1>

            <p class="job paragraph" id="paragraph-1">When you leave work what do you do? Most likely, you go home go, sit on the couch watch love and hip-hop or you play 2k until its time to go to bed. Instead of wasting that time, you could be doing something to make money. Assuming you have no kids,  aren't married, have a lot of time on your hands, and few responsibilities, then this is the perfect time to pick up a side job. It doesnt have to be a hard or stressful job, just something that brings you in extra income. I promise you both your  current and future self will thank you when you have a nice amount in the bank.</p>

      <h1>Q:I want to get in the stock market but I dont really know how. What should I do?</h1>
      <h1>A:The easiest way to get started for beginners is to use an app called Acorns.</h1>

            <p class="readmore" id="more-2" onclick="showmore(2)"><a href="#">Read more &gt;</a></p>
            <p class="job paragraph" id="paragraph-2">Acorns is what you call a "Roboadvisor" what acorns does is it links your credit/debit cards to an investment account and adds your spare change into that account. For example, If I spend $11.40 acorns will take that remaining $.60 and put it in the stock market. The best thing about this is that it is automatic so you dont even think about it. It might be a small amount of change but you have the option of adding more. You also have the option of setting up a recurring amount, but Acorns  is the best way to start investing Remember this is for long-term investing so DON'T TOUCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

       <h1>Q:I'm in my 20's whats are things I should be focused on right now?</h1>
       <h1>A:The two main things I would focus on at this point in my life building credit and growing your bank account.</h1>

            <p class="job paragraph" id="paragraph-3">Your credit is one of the most important things you will ever have to your name and  fixing bad credit in not easy. As a young person graduating from college and starting work there are plenty of things you'll want to do, buy a car, rent an apartment, or buy a house.  For some things you'll need loans, and with any loan there comes an interest rate. The better your credit score, the lower your interest rate. Fun Fact: your credit score will also impact your insurance premium so you definiely want to make sure that is 700 or higher. This is pretty obvious but you want to have an emergency fund of 3-6 months worth of expenses . To be frank, shit happens and your bills dont stop coming, but if your bills dont get paid then your credit goes down, everything is related. Also, you want to have money for the future. I've only been broke one time in my life and it was the worst feeling in the world. Not being able to do what I want when I want because of money is a hard thing to deal with. My advice, work hard, be smart, and grow your savings account, its the best thing you could ever do. So if that means staying in sometimes or passing  up on that trip to Vegas then do it. This is not to say you shouldn't live your life, but dont act like the next day, or week or month isnt coming either.  </p>

        <h1>Q:Should I be thinking about purchasing a house as opposed to renting an apartment?</h1>
        <h1>A: It depends on which stage of your life you're in. For some it makes sense for others it does not.</h1> 


            <p class="readmore" id="more-4" onclick="showmore(4)"><a href="#">Read more &gt;</a></p>
            <p class="job paragraph" id="paragraph-4">There are plenty of benefits to buying a home/condo as opposed to renting but in my opinion there are alot more drawbacks for anyone who's in their mid to late twenties. buying a home is considered an investment and a way to build equity and not to feel like you're throwing money away by renting. It also can be cheaper depending on the cost of your house and I left out some things but thats essentially the benefits of buying a house/condo. Renting is as simple as paying first and last months rent and a security deposit. You also have the flexibility to break a lease if you need to which is alot cheaper and easier than selling a house and even if you dont want to break your lease the lenght of it is only a year in most cases so its definitely short term unlike buying a home. When purchasing a home that flexibility is no longer there. It is recommended you stay in a home for at least five years to have the best chance of gaining a profit because homes values can increase and decrease so having a quick turnaround can have consequences. Buying a home is also a lot of work from bank loans paperwork a decent downpayment and so many other things so if you're not financially and mentally prepared for that step then it might not be for you. Outside of the financial aspect, owning a home takes a significant amount of time and money. When something goes wrong in an apartment, a simple call to the front desk will have a handyman up within a day free of charge. When you own and something goes wrong guess who's resposible for getting it fixed. Not to mention the upkeep the insurance the taxes and the risk of losing money when you do have to sell. All of these factors are things to be considered when you think you are ready. Its also important to not feel like you are throwing away money by renting. Renting a home tests your patience and the more patience you have the bigger the downpayemt you will be able to secure, assuming you are saving correctly. </p>
