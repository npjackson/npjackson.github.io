    <h2 id="story">My Story</h2>

    <p class="story">At 22/23 I was broke unemployed and depressed. I graduated in 4 years with a finance degree. I Had two job interviews the Monday after graduation and in my head I did everything right. I Thought post grad life was going to be sweet. I'd have this nice finance job in downtown Chicago, making $60k fresh out of college. I couldnt have been more wrong. After countless interviews, countless second interviews and countless times I heard "we decided to go in a different direction" 11 months later, Im Still unemployed. My first job I was an assistant manager at walmart, payed well but was the worst job ever. I could tell plenty of horror stories about customers trying to return clearly used underwear to my subordinates constantly challenging me. Again, I still a finance degree working at Wal-Mart. I did that job for eight long months and then my career finally started as an Alternative Investment Analyst at Northern Trust. Mind you, I had 6 different interviews with this company, not only that, my uncle is a senior VP at Northern Trust and still had no luck and quid pro quo didnt apply to me. It took 19 months for my career to start and that was the most humbling time of my life. Fast forward to now, it all worked out. Im currently a financial analyst for Allstate, a job that has been everything I needed for personal and career growth. I got to move to another state and experience another part of the country and I got a nice raise. So I'm a living testimony for anyone that's stuck in life just know it doesn't have to be permanent.</p>

    <h2 id="financial">My Financial Journey</h2>

    <p class="journey">My financial journey starts long before I was even working. My mother has always been a personal finance wizard and she always made sure to pass whatever she knew on to me at a young age. From simple things like how to balance a checkbook to organization to never paying full price for things. Personal finance is not just something you do when you’re saving or when you’re broke; personal finance is a lifestyle. It’s not for everyone but I will say people who live by this are usually financially secure. Asking simple questions such as how does this affect me down the line or could this money be used for something better are things you should ask. <br><br>

The common practice of buying things through emotion is probably why you have a closet full of shoes you haven’t worn or thousands of shirts in your closet that still have the tags on them. It was a sale or it was just really nice so impulse kicked in and then you justified it with logic later. The “ehh I can always take it back” or “it wasn’t that much” or my favorite “I can treat myself”. All impulse buys that could’ve and should’ve been avoided but you couldn’t resist. Not to say I don’t do this because its human nature but self-control is my saving grace or my closet would look worse than it does. Its not self-control when you’re broke and cant afford it, self control is when you have all the money in the world and still decide against it and that’s where I am at now. 
<br><br>
Now back to me. 2017 has been my most important year to date. In November of 2016 I received a job offer to move to Virginia to be a financial analyst for Allstate. I got a pretty sizeable raise from my current position and a signing bonus so I’d like to call this a very financially important year for me. On top of my full-time job I do uber part time. Every day after work, I get in my car and cut my uber app on and go from 5pm to 10pm. Needless to say, I have very long days. Also needless to say, I make a lot of money just by that. Its extremely hard work to do a full eight hours at work and then do another 5 hours driving so I work about 70 hours a week.  Tired doesn’t even begin to describe my days but it’s more than worth it when those weekly paychecks roll around. I know the you need to rest and take a break and blah blah blah but this is the easiest point of my life to where I can set myself up financially so its more than worth it.
<br><br>

Another thing I’ve done this year is got a life insurance policy and a will. I don’t want to get too much into this but this was something very necessary for my future, as it will protect me if the unfortunate happens and it will save me money down the line. I know you might think your jobs life insurance is enough but think again. It’s not enough and I found that out before I had any health concerns that would make it hard for me to get a policy. 
<br><br>

This is a small sample of my life that I wanted to share and I’ll be sharing more as time goes on about my personal come ups and pitfalls that I hope you can avoid or take adherence to but thank you for reading and there will be more to come.

    <h2 id="why">Why I started this site</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="start">Initially I wanted to start a YouTube channel to education millenials particularly black millenials in finance and financial awareness but I got lazy because I didnt want to learn editing and whatnot. I stay on top of these things because I took it upon myself to learn but I understand that everyone isnt like that and its not your fault. We as black people are not told or taught about investing in the stock market, life insurance and how your credit works so I want this site to be that for people who are interested in it. I got alot of phone calls and tweets from my friends asking for finance advice and I know its a need for young professionals. I have set myself up for long term financial health and I dont want to be the only one of my friends to not be living paycheck to paycheck or not be prepared for things down the line. So I hope this site gives you insight and perspective on finances. I also want this site to be a place where people share their career stories for anyone looking to do similar things or just for encouragement. Thats why I began this site with my story. I feel like it is so important to tell these stories and for people to hear them because you can avoid alot of pitfalls of other people just by listening because a wise person learns from the mistakes of others not from learning them on your own. Im not a financial advisor or anything like that I just want to get the conversation started and grow it from there and I hope this site helps you in any place you might be in your life. </p>
